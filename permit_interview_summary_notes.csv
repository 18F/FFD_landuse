They probably felt that they have to treat everyone the same so we have to be careful about contacts and not give someone an advantage""

How often do businesses want to expand what they do to additional parks?,"I guess in the last year I’ve played around with researching the difference between CUA and concession contracts, you go to the parks websites and they say “here are the CUA holders”"
Outfitter or Guide,Sailing trips / guiding / interpretive,Relationship + Permit Process,"Before getting the permit, the perceived risk of getting denied and sinking his business outweighed the reward to go through with the permit process.","This reinforces the theme from a couple interviews that parks sometimes don't necessarily see vendors as partners, but rather as possible threats",,"""one of the reasons I didn’t apply originally is because of the risk of getting turned down. Because it wasn’t straightforward what you needed, and I had to go through Biscayne to go from Miami to the Keys."""

Outfitter or Guide,This outfitter primarily plans trips and buys entry permits on behalf of customers,Relationship,,Relationship between outfitters and land management agencies seems very good.,Why is the relationship so good in this particular situation? History? Being outfitters (enablers of the public versus direct users?),"""They’re very open to having us call with questions - I have contact info of a couple different FS personnel. So I can call whenever. They host a cooperators meeting, which they hold 2 or 3 times per year, to tell us about new regulations, rules, prescribed burns, etc which affect us.""

""The vibe I got from the cooperator meetings was, we’re here to help you. We trust that you as an issuing station you’ll follow the rules. We report if portages need work back to the FS and they’ll send out a crew to fix it. So the relationship is “we’re here to help each other”"

Outfitter or Guide,Cooperating Association,Relationship,"Challenge: At least with some Nat'l Parks, there may be some tension internally over if/how to enable more public access",,,"""Half of those people understand the importance of getting people inside the park and wanting them to explore it and support.
