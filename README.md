# USA.gov and Permitting - Foundation Engagement | Spring 2017
This repository contains research data and subsequent recommendations following a study of land-use permitting across various federal agencies. 

## Abstract
[Federal Front Door](https://labs.usa.gov/#research-report) research suggested that outfitters and guides face a burden when applying for multiple commercial use permits. We investigated that claim and discovered that permitting processes follow the same general steps across the federal government :

1. Contact Office 
2. Complete Application
3. Discuss and Negotiate Plan
4. Approve or Reject
5. Report Trips 

Frustrations amongst operators manifested in steps 3 and 4. The negotiation of specific land uses are a larger point of tension than application paperwork. USA.gov cannot resolve these tensions regarding local policy decisions. 

We identified two ways USA.gov could facilitate a stronger conversation:

**Path 1**
> Point operators to the right agency contacts and set clear expectations.

**Path 2**
> Simplify reporting; build a system to burdensome trip tracking.
