# USA.gov and Permitting - Foundation Engagement | Spring 2017
This repository contains research data and subsequent recommendations following a study of land-use permitting across various federal agencies. 

## Abstract
Initial [Federal Front Door](https://labs.usa.gov/#research-report) research suggested that outfitters and guides face a burden when applying for multiple commercial use permits with federal land management agencies, and that a cross-agency information sharing opportunity might exist to solve this problem.

The USA.gov program therefore engaged 18F to learn more about the problem landscape as well as assess the viability of building a service to improve the user experience of land-use permit requests.

## Initial research goals
1. Explore/understand the challenges that agencies have with the permitting process. 
2. Explore/understand the challenges that end users (guides/outfitters) have with the permitting process. 
3. Understand if there is a role for USA.gov to play in improving some piece of the permitting experience, and make recommendations to USA.gov on possible approaches to do that.

See more detail in the [Research Plan](https://github.com/18F/FFD_landuse/blob/master/usagov_landuse_permits_research.pdf).

## Summary of Findings

- The actual application to start the permit process is not the hard part for permittees.
- Outdoors companies are aware of who, what, and where they need to apply.
- Land management agency operations and policy favor the general public over outfitters and guides.
- General public access is prioritized over commercial access for any given space.
- USA.gov doesnâ€™t have a clean, shoe-in opportunity to build a system that would fix systemic challenges - many of which stem from the way the land management agencies are organized (highly decentralized).

See more detail in the [mid-flight research report](https://github.com/18F/FFD_landuse/blob/master/usagov_midflight_findings.pdf).

We discovered that permitting processes follow the same general steps across the federal government :

1. Contact Office 
2. Complete Application
3. Discuss and Negotiate Plan
4. Approve or Reject
5. Report Trips 

Frustrations amongst operators manifested in steps 3 and 4. The negotiation of specific land uses are a larger point of tension than application paperwork. USA.gov cannot resolve these tensions regarding local policy decisions. 

## What could & should USA.gov do?
Next, we identified three building blocks USA.gov could leverage to impact the space:

 1. Referrals & content syndication
 2. Find & repurpose cross-agency data
 3. Gather, store, and share user data

We combined our research findings and these three levers to generate 10 different potential project opportunities, which we plotted on a graph by potential impact versus risk (effort, difficulty).

We then conducted a [Decision Making](https://github.com/18F/FFD_landuse/blob/master/usagov_landuse_permits_workshop.pdf) workshop to evaluate potential paths based on constraints important to USA.gov, such as impact, cooperation required from the agency, relevance to USA.gov mission, and resources required.

## Conclusion

Through the workshop and ensuing discussions, we identified the two strongest potential ways USA.gov could pursue to improve the experience of permitting for outfitters and guides.

**Path 1**
> Point operators to the right agency contacts and set clear expectations.

Path 1 would entail building out the 18F prototype to help guides and outfitters identify agency contact information, and creating and providing specific content on USA.gov targeted to permit applicants.


**Path 2**
> Simplify reporting; build a system to burdensome trip tracking.

Path 2 would entail building a prototype in partnership with a specific forest and set of guide/outfitter users to explore whether a streamlined usage reporting tool would provide value to both forest and businesses, and potentially serve as a gateway for building out further communication and permit management functionality.

## Addendum
After the decision making workshop, we were able to get follow up information and interviews with three of our original interviewees, including two Forest Service employees and one guide/outfitter. These conversations confirmed that trip planning and reporting, which is tied to both land use management and fee gathering, is an area that is ripe for significant improvement. If USA.gov wants to pursue creating a shared permitting or reporting management system, and especially if USA.gov were able to get Forest Service buy-in, Path 2 would be a good option. Pursuit of that path would require a fully dedicated, cross-functional team to navigate the complexity of different communications preferences and reporting frameworks. Additionally, strong product management skills would be required on the team, to oversee the development of the product while working to expand the service beyond the pilot forest and guide/outfitter users.
